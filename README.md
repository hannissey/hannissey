ðŸ‘‹ Hello, I'm Hannah, a website designer and developer.</br>

I've got 10 years experience in the field and have always learned on the job.
As a result, my knowledge is patchy so I'm looking to consolidate my skills.
As of March 2022, I'll be studying a Masters in Computer Science.
I've been advised to look into Java and brush up on my Maths skills before the course starts.
I'm also interested in Laravel (PHP) and React (Javascript) to build websites.
</br>Always learning, and always missing the obvious (eg ;)! Give me a nudge if you've any helpful suggestions!

Currently reading:
- :green_book: Java In Two Semesters (4th Edition) by Quentin Charatan and Aaron Kans
- :blue_book: Pro Git by Ben Straub and Scott Chacon
